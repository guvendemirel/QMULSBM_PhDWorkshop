    "# QMUL SBM PHD Python Workshop \n",
    "## Part 1 - Introduction to Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first part of the PhD Workshop on [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming. In the first session, we will introduce the basics of programming with Python, in which we will look at variable assignments and different data types (numerical, text, list, tuples, sets, and dictionaries). In the next sessions, we will continue with building blocks of programming (conditional statements, loops, functions), the Numpy package, reading and cleaning tabular data and EDA with Pandas and processing textual data with natural language processing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Python and Jupyter Notebook on Your Personal Computers\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install Python and Jupyter Notebook by downloading the most recent stable version of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution. Different interpreters and development environments can be used with Python. We will use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which is a web browser based application that allows you to run and to insert text, equations, and graphics. These can be directly opened on Google Colab as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you can open a Jupyter notebook into which you can write code and execute. Follow the steps on [Jupyter Notebook website](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) for operating system specific instructions, which involves running `jupyter notebook` in a terminal. You can `rename` and `save` notebooks from the `File` menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown and Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "You can insert **code** and **markdown** cells into Jupyter notebooks. Code cells are for typing and running Python code. Markdown cells are for the text content and organizing and formatting documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can add section titles by `#`, `##`, `###`, you can create numbered and bullet lists by starting the line with the corresponding marker, e.g. `1.`,`2.`, `3.`. You can format text for instance by `*italic_text*` and `**bold_text**`. Visit [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for further details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the cell type from the drop-down menu at the top or choose the cell and press the keys <kbd>y</kbd> and <kbd>m</kbd> for the code and the markdown cells, respectively. In Google Colab, you need to press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd> + <kbd>y</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, meaning that you can freely execute different segments of code (which are cells on Jupyter notebooks) without the need to compile it first to the machine code. This reduces the development time and facilitates experimentation with data in an interactive way but slows down execution, especially for computationally intensive tasks. This is why most heavy computations are implemented in other languages such as C and C++, which is then wrapped in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on *Run* or hit <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>  (also <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> in Jupyter notebook) shortcuts, it runs the selected cell (more options under *Cell*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall now start using Python as a simple calculator. You can use the operators `+` (add), `-` (substract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), `**` (power), `%` (modulus) in *expressions*. For instance:"
